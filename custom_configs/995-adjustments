 To connect to an access point that uses a password, you need to put the pre-shared key in /etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-wifi0.conf. SSID is the string that the access point/router transmits to identify itself. Run the following command as the root user:

wpa_passphrase SSID SECRET_PASSWORD > /etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-wifi0.conf

/etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-wifi0.conf can hold the details of several access points. When wpa_supplicant is started, it will scan for the SSIDs it can see and choose the appropriate password to connect.

If you want to connect to an access point that isn't password protected, put an entry like this in /etc/sysconfig/wpa_supplicant-wifi0.conf. Replace "Some-SSID" with the SSID of the access point/router.

network={
  ssid="Some-SSID"
  key_mgmt=NONE
}
